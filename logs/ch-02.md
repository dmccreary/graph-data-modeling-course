### Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Level | Count | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Remember (L1) | 1 | Simple Data Types Reference infographic |
| Understand (L2) | 2 | Node Anatomy, Edge Types diagrams |
| Apply (L3) | 3 | Path Traversal MicroSim, Assertion Workflow, Query Pattern Builder |

| Create (L6) | 0 | (Covered in later chapters) |

### Skills Required for Implementation

The following skills should be used to implement the diagram specifications:

1. **microsim-p5** - For Path Traversal MicroSim, Quality Dashboard, Query Pattern Builder
2. **vis-network** - For Edge Types visualization, Learning Dependency Graph
3. **chartjs-generator** - For Quality Metrics Overview Chart
4. **mermaid-generator** - For Assertion Workflow diagram

### Notes

- Content follows college-level reading guidelines (18-25 word sentences, technical terminology with definitions)
- Tone is engaging with humor ("refactoring at 3 AM while questioning your career choices")
- Analogies used throughout (nodes as nouns, edges as verbs, alphabet before poetry)
- Progressive complexity from foundational concepts to quality frameworks
- Strong ties to glossary definitions
- Cypher code examples used throughout for practical illustration
- Collapsible knowledge check question included for self-assessment

### Follow-Up Actions

1. Implement 8 interactive elements using appropriate generator skills
2. Review generated content for technical accuracy
3. Test all code examples
4. Verify MkDocs rendering of admonitions and collapsible sections
