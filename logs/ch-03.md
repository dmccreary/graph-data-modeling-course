### Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Level | Count | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Remember (L1) | 1 | Individual Customer Node diagram |
| Understand (L2) | 5 | Customer Entity, Location Hierarchy, Corporate Structure, License Assignment |
| Apply (L3) | 1 | Household Builder MicroSim |
| Analyze (L4) | 2 | Family Relationship Graph, Abuse Detection Patterns |
| Evaluate (L5) | 1 | IP Activity Visualizer MicroSim |
| Create (L6) | 0 | (Knowledge check prompts create-level thinking) |

### Skills Required for Implementation

The following skills should be used to implement the diagram specifications:

1. **microsim-p5** - For Household Builder, IP Activity Visualizer
2. **vis-network** - For Location Hierarchy, Family Relationship, Corporate Structure, License Assignment
3. **map-generator** - For IP Activity Visualizer (world map component)

### Cypher Query Examples Included

| Query Purpose | Complexity |
|---------------|------------|
| Individual customer node creation | Basic |
| Location hierarchy connections | Basic |
| Address relationships | Basic |
| Household membership | Intermediate |
| Family relationship traversal (grandchildren) | Intermediate |
| Spouse shopping patterns | Intermediate |
| Combined family LTV | Advanced |
| Corporate hierarchy | Intermediate |
| License compliance (over seats) | Intermediate |
| Unused license detection | Advanced |
| User access rights | Intermediate |
| Account sharing abuse | Advanced |
| Trial abuse detection | Advanced |
| Fake household detection | Advanced |
| IP access queries (3 variations) | Intermediate |
| Complete customer model creation | Advanced |
| Total relationship value calculation | Advanced |

### Notes

- Content follows college-level reading guidelines with engaging tone
- Humor examples: "SQL joins that make grown engineers weep", "customers occasionally try to game your licensing system"
- Strong practical focus with real-world scenarios (Netflix sharing, B2B software licensing)
- Extensive Cypher code examples throughout (~25 code blocks)
- Progressive complexity from simple entity modeling to abuse detection patterns
- Clear distinction between similar concepts (Location vs Address, Household vs Family)
- Collapsible knowledge check with gym membership design exercise

### Follow-Up Actions

1. Implement 6 interactive elements using appropriate generator skills
2. Review Cypher query examples for syntax accuracy
3. Consider adding more visualizations for the abuse detection section
4. Test MkDocs rendering of complex code blocks
