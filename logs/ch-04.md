### Key Pedagogical Features

1. **Opening Hook**: Amazon's $150-170B recommendation revenue immediately establishes real-world stakes
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Starts with basic product nodes, builds to advanced fraud detection
3. **Practical Examples**: E-commerce scenarios throughout (laptops, headphones, etc.)
4. **Code Examples**: Cypher-style queries demonstrating graph patterns
5. **Interactive Elements**: Two MicroSims enable hands-on exploration
6. **Real Statistics**: Amazon removal of 200M fake reviews provides context
7. **Summary Section**: Collapsible key takeaways for review
8. **Exercises**: 5 exercises covering schema design, taxonomies, queries, embeddings, and business analysis

## Reading Level Adaptation

College undergraduate characteristics applied:

- Average sentence length: 18-25 words
- Technical terminology with concise definitions
- Case studies and research context (Amazon)
- Balance between practical and theoretical
- Expects critical thinking and analysis
- Professional tone with engaging delivery

## Tone Characteristics

Fun, humorous, positive and optimistic elements:

- "Let's dive in!" enthusiasm
- "Here's a number that should make you sit up straight"
- "The Dark Side of Social Proof" section title
- "Angry reds and oranges" for fraud visualization
- "Get ready to put products on the map—literally!" closing
- Conversational asides throughout
