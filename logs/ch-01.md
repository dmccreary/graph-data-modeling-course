### Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. Run `microsim-p5` skill for Knowledge Triangle Explorer MicroSim
2. Run `microsim-p5` skill for PageRank Visualizer MicroSim
3. Run `vis-network` skill for Simple Social Graph Model
4. Create static diagrams for Knowledge Triangle and RAG comparison
5. Run `vis-network` or D3.js for Chapter Concept Map infographic
