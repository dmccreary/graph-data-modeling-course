# Modeling Space

## Summary

This chapter addresses the challenges of spatial modeling in graphs. We cover location modeling with coordinates, address hierarchies, regional classifications, road networks, and spatial algorithms like shortest path and traveling salesperson solutions.

## Concepts Covered

1. Spatial Challenges
2. Location Modeling
3. Longitude and Latitude
4. Distance Calculations
5. Address Modeling
6. City/County/State Model
7. Metropolitan Regions
8. Sales Regions
9. Urban/Rural Regions
10. Social Determinants
11. Road Modeling
12. Shortest Path
13. Traveling Salesperson
14. Bus Routes
15. Provider Distance
16. Geospatial Models

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Model locations with geographic coordinates
- Build address hierarchies connecting cities, counties, and states
- Implement regional classifications for sales and demographics
- Apply shortest path algorithms to road networks
- Calculate distances between entities for proximity analysis
- Design geospatial models for real-world applications
