# Learning Systems

## Summary

This chapter explores how to model learning systems using graphs. We cover learning graphs, concept dependencies, content models, learning paths, recommendations, and how these concepts enable intelligent textbooks and adaptive learning.

## Concepts Covered

1. Learning Graphs
2. Concept Dependencies
3. Concept Models
4. Content Models
5. Learning Paths
6. Path Recommendations
7. Content Recommendations
8. Intelligent Textbooks

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Design learning graphs with concept dependencies
- Model concepts and content as connected nodes
- Build learning paths respecting prerequisite relationships
- Implement recommendation algorithms for content and paths
- Create intelligent textbook structures using graphs
- Apply DAG principles to ensure valid learning sequences
