# Modeling Products

## Summary

This chapter covers how to model products in a graph database, including product taxonomies, groupings, and classifications. We explore how to use embeddings and vector stores for product similarity and recommendation systems.

## Concepts Covered

1. Product Lists
2. Product Groupings
3. Product Taxonomies
4. Multiple Taxonomies
5. Classification Tools
6. Product Similarity
7. Product Embeddings
8. Product Metadata

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Design product nodes with appropriate properties and metadata
- Create hierarchical product taxonomies using graph relationships
- Implement multiple overlapping classification systems
- Use embeddings to calculate product similarity
- Build recommendation systems based on product relationships
