# Modeling Code

## Summary

This chapter explores how to model software code as graphs. We cover code graphs, call graphs, dependency analysis, test coverage mapping, code quality metrics, and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

## Concepts Covered

1. Code Graphs
2. Nodes as Functions
3. Edges as Dependencies
4. Directed Graphs
5. Undirected Graphs
6. Weighted Edges
7. Call Graphs
8. Dead Code Detection
9. Recursive Functions
10. Circular Dependencies
11. Text Coverage Graphs
12. Test-Code Mapping
13. Hybrid Graphs
14. Cyclomatic Complexity
15. Code Churn
16. Code Hotspots
17. Static Analysis
18. Dynamic Analysis
19. CI/CD Integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Model functions and dependencies as graph structures
- Build call graphs showing function invocations
- Detect dead code and circular dependencies
- Map test coverage to code using graphs
- Calculate code quality metrics like cyclomatic complexity
- Identify code hotspots through churn analysis
- Integrate code graphs with CI/CD pipelines
