# Entity Resolution

## Summary

This chapter addresses the challenge of connecting disparate data sources through entity resolution. We explore techniques for matching identical and similar attributes, algorithms like SoundEx, and how embeddings and vector stores enable modern entity resolution.

## Concepts Covered

1. Data Connection
2. Identical Attributes
3. Similar Attributes
4. SoundEx Algorithm
5. Nickname Matching
6. Similarity Metrics
7. Embeddings
8. Vector Stores ER
9. Graph Advantage for ER

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Identify entity resolution challenges in graph modeling
- Apply exact and fuzzy matching techniques
- Use SoundEx and nickname matching for name resolution
- Calculate similarity metrics between entities
- Leverage embeddings for semantic entity matching
- Explain the graph advantage for entity resolution
