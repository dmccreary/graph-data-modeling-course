# Bitemporal Modeling

## Summary

This chapter addresses the challenge of modeling time in two dimensions: when things happened in the real world versus when they were recorded in the system. We explore bitemporal graphs and how to maintain both real-world time and system time.

## Concepts Covered

1. Bitemporal Graphs
2. Real World Time
3. System Time

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Explain the difference between real-world time and system time
- Design bitemporal models tracking both time dimensions
- Query graph data at specific points in both timelines
- Handle corrections and late-arriving data
- Build audit-compliant temporal models
- Connect bitemporal concepts to previous time modeling
