# Scene Graphs

## Summary

This chapter covers scene graphs for visual understanding and robotics applications. We explore how graphs model 3D scenes, pixel classification, movement prediction, and applications in autonomous vehicles and robotics.

## Concepts Covered

1. Scene Graphs
2. Pixel Classification
3. Movement Prediction
4. Autonomous Vehicles
5. Robotics Applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Design scene graphs representing visual environments
- Model spatial relationships between objects in scenes
- Connect pixel classification to graph structures
- Apply movement prediction using graph patterns
- Build models for autonomous vehicle navigation
- Design robotics applications using scene graphs
