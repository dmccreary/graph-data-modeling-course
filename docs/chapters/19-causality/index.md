# Causality Modeling

## Summary

This chapter explores how to model causal relationships in graphs. We cover the distinction between correlation and causation, causal graphs, systems thinking, causal loop diagrams, and Bayesian network analysis for understanding cause and effect.

## Concepts Covered

1. Correlation vs Causation
2. Causal Graphs
3. Systems Thinking
4. Causality Data Flows
5. Causal Loop Diagrams
6. Consumer Preference Models
7. Bayesian Network Analysis

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Distinguish correlation from causation in data
- Design causal graphs showing cause-effect relationships
- Apply systems thinking to model complex interactions
- Build causal loop diagrams for feedback analysis
- Model consumer preferences using causal structures
- Implement Bayesian networks in graph databases
