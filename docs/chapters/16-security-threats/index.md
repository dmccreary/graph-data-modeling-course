# Security Threat Modeling

## Summary

This chapter covers how to model security threats using graphs. We explore server and network modeling, threat identification and prioritization, vulnerability assessment, role-based access control, and monitoring agents.

## Concepts Covered

1. Server Modeling
2. Network Modeling
3. Threat Modeling
4. Threat Prioritization
5. Vulnerability Assessment
6. Person Roles
7. Role-Based Access Control
8. RBAC and Performance
9. Monitoring Agents

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Model servers and networks as graph structures
- Design threat models identifying attack vectors
- Prioritize threats based on graph analysis
- Conduct vulnerability assessments using graphs
- Implement role-based access control in graphs
- Optimize RBAC for performance
- Design monitoring systems using graph patterns
