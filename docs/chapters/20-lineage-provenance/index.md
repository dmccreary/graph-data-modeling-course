# Lineage and Provenance

## Summary

This chapter covers how to model data lineage and provenance in graphs. We explore the core concepts of entities, activities, and agents, the W3C PROV standard, and how graphs naturally represent the flow and transformation of data.

## Concepts Covered

1. Lineage and Provenance
2. Entity Definition
3. Activity Definition
4. Agent Definition
5. DM-Prov Model
6. W3C Provenance

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Define lineage and provenance in data management
- Model entities, activities, and agents as graph nodes
- Implement the DM-Prov model in a graph database
- Apply W3C Provenance standards to data flows
- Track data transformations through graph traversal
- Build audit trails using provenance graphs
