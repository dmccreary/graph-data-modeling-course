# Metadata Modeling

## Summary

This chapter covers how to model metadata in graphs for data governance and management. We explore metadata definitions, data governance structures, stewardship, domains, and how graphs enable schema matching and data mapping.

## Concepts Covered

1. Metadata Definition
2. Data Governance
3. Data Stewards
4. Data Domains
5. Data Matching
6. Schema Matching
7. Data Mapping

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Define metadata and its role in data governance
- Model governance structures with stewards and domains
- Design data domain hierarchies in graphs
- Implement schema matching algorithms
- Build data mapping relationships between systems
- Connect metadata to operational data models
