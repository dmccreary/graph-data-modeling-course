# Graph Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter covers the core building blocks of graph databases: nodes, edges, properties, and paths. We explore data types, dependencies, and graph quality measures that form the foundation for all subsequent modeling work.

## Concepts Covered

1. Nodes
2. Edges
3. Properties
4. Simple Data Types
5. Complex Data Types
6. Paths
7. Dependencies
8. Graph Quality
9. Quality Measures
10. Graph Constraints
11. Quality Assertions
12. Quality Scores
13. Quality Dashboards
14. Graph Query Language

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Define nodes, edges, and properties in a graph database
- Distinguish between simple and complex data types
- Explain how paths represent connections through a graph
- Describe dependency relationships and their importance
- Apply graph quality measures and constraints to validate models
- Use basic graph query language concepts
