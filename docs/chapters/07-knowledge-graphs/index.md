# Knowledge Graphs and Concepts

## Summary

This chapter introduces knowledge graphs and semantic modeling. We explore the semantic spectrum from glossaries to ontologies, the SKOS standard for organizing concepts, and how to model concept hierarchies with labels, relationships, and schemas.

## Concepts Covered

1. Knowledge Graphs
2. The Semantic Spectrum
3. SKOS Standard
4. SKOS in LPG
5. Acronyms and Abbreviations
6. Business Glossaries
7. Taxonomies
8. Ontologies
9. Concept Nodes
10. Concept Labels
11. Preferred Labels
12. Alternate Labels
13. Broader/Narrower
14. Semantic Variability
15. Concept Schemas
16. GraphRAG Challenges

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Explain the semantic spectrum from data to knowledge
- Implement SKOS concepts in a labeled property graph
- Design taxonomies with broader/narrower relationships
- Model concepts with preferred and alternate labels
- Build business glossaries connected to data models
- Address GraphRAG challenges with knowledge graphs
