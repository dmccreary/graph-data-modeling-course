# Introduction to Graph Data Modeling

## Summary

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of graph data modeling and explains why it has become critical in the age of AI. We explore the emerging GraphRAG pattern, world models, and how graph databases serve as an organization's central nervous system for real-time responses to natural language queries.

1. Graph Data Model
2. World Models
3. GraphRAG Pattern
4. Vector Stores
5. Semantic Indexes
6. Real-Time Systems
7. Knowledge Triangle
8. Data Layer
9. Information Layer
10. Knowledge Layer
11. Sensor Data
12. Page Rank Algorithm
13. Relational Models
14. Analytical Models
15. Key-Value Stores
16. Document Models
17. ISO GQL Standard
18. Graph and LLM Integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Define what a graph data model is and its core components
- Explain the GraphRAG pattern and its importance for AI applications
- Describe the Knowledge Triangle and its three layers
- Compare graph databases to other data models (relational, key-value, document)
- Understand how graphs integrate with large language models
