# Model Evolution

## Summary

This chapter addresses how graph models evolve over time. We explore tradeoff analysis, performance considerations, scalability, sustainability, complexity management, cost-benefit analysis, and the network effects that emerge as models grow.

## Concepts Covered

1. Tradeoff Analysis
2. Graph Training
3. Graph Performance
4. Transactional Integrity
5. Scalability
6. Sustainability
7. Graph Storytelling
8. Model Expansion
9. Complex Adaptive Systems
10. Edge of Chaos
11. Model Complexity
12. Cost-Benefit Analysis
13. Initial Project Costs
14. Ongoing Project Costs
15. Network Effects

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Analyze tradeoffs in graph model design
- Evaluate performance implications of modeling decisions
- Plan for scalability and sustainability
- Apply complexity theory to model design
- Conduct cost-benefit analysis for graph projects
- Explain network effects in graph-based systems
