# Modeling Rules

## Summary

This chapter covers how to model business rules, workflows, and decision logic in graphs. We explore rule engines, in-graph rules, BPMN notation, decision trees, validation rules, and the performance advantages of graph-based rule execution.

## Concepts Covered

1. Rule Engines
2. Context Transfer Challenge
3. In-Graph Rules
4. Rules and Workflows
5. Rule Modeling
6. BPMN Notation
7. Decision Trees
8. Validation Rules
9. Data Mining
10. Process Mining
11. Rule Execution
12. Rule Exchange
13. Performance Advantage

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Design rule models within graph databases
- Solve the context transfer challenge with in-graph rules
- Model workflows using BPMN notation in graphs
- Build decision trees as graph structures
- Implement validation rules as graph constraints
- Apply process mining to discover rules from data
- Explain the performance advantage of graph-based rules
