# Supply Chain Modeling

## Summary

This chapter covers how to model supply chains in graphs. We explore inventory management, supplier relationships, disruption analysis, and transportation network optimization.

## Concepts Covered

1. Inventory Management
2. Alternate Suppliers
3. Supply Chain Disruption
4. Transportation Networks

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

- Model inventory as nodes connected to suppliers and products
- Design alternate supplier relationships for resilience
- Analyze supply chain disruptions through graph traversal
- Optimize transportation networks using graph algorithms
- Connect supply chain models to product and location graphs
