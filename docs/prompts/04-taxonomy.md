# Concept Taxonomy

## Prompt

!!! prompt
    Now lets focus again on the 150 concepts you have generated.
    Your task is to organize these concepts into a small taxonomy
    of approximately ten classifiers.  You will generate a list
    of the classifier labels.

    Here are some suggestions.  The first category is "Foundational Concepts".
    These are concepts that are introduced at the start of the course
    and are considered prerequisites.
    A second category is "Concept Definitions" where we introduce new terms.
    One category might be "Domain Specific Models"
    A last category can be "Miscellaneous".
    Your task is to create the rest of the classifiers and give each classifier a label and definition.
    Each category should include concepts that share similar characteristics, functions, or applications.
    Attempt to create a taxonomy that will evenly divide the 150 concepts into a somewhat balanced taxonomy.

## Response

Check unused concepts that fit product/supply chain:
Try (109) Person Roles was used? Yes in Customer category.
(121) Building Models used in category 3.
(106) Threat Modeling fits better in security.

Try (135) Data Mining was used in textual.
(136) Rule Exchange - more business rules.
