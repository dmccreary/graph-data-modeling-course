# Concept Enumeration

!!! prompt
    Next, please create an enumerated list of the 150 key Concepts in this course on graph data modeling.  The list should be ordered from the simplest introductory concepts such as foundational concepts and definitions to the most complex topics at the end of the list.

    For each Concept, return a sequential ID and a ConceptLabel.
    The ConceptLabel should be under 30 characters long.
    Only use abbreviations in the ConceptLabel if the ConceptLabel is over 30 characters long.
    Make sure that each Concept only appears once on the list.  Avoid duplicate concepts.
