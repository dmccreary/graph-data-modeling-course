## Response

**Course Title: Graph Data Modeling**

## Course Description

This course explores the foundational principles and advanced techniques of graph data modeling, to progressively develop students' skills in data modeling. Students will begin by understanding the fundamental concepts and terminology, then advance to applying graph modeling strategies across diverse domains, analyzing complex relationships, evaluating modeling trade-offs, and ultimately creating robust, domain-specific graph data models.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

1.  **Remember** key graph modeling concepts, including nodes, edges, properties, and paths.
2.  **Understand** the significance of graph data models in representing real-world systems and relationships.
3.  **Apply** graph modeling techniques to domains such as customer management, healthcare, supply chains, and fraud detection.
4.  **Analyze** domain-specific requirements to identify optimal graph structures and relationships.
5.  **Evaluate** trade-offs in architectural and performance considerations for graph models.
6.  **Create** advanced and scalable graph models for dynamic and evolving systems, including digital twins, causality, and metadata.

## Topics Covered

-   **Foundations of Graph Data Modeling:** Introduction to graph concepts, ISO GQL, and future trends.
-   **Core Concepts:** Nodes, edges, properties, and paths.
-   **Domain-Specific Modeling:** Customer data, products, healthcare, security threats, and fraud.
-   **Advanced Topics:** Bitemporal modeling, causality, supply chains, and metadata.
-   **Future Directions:** Model evolution, scalability, sustainability, and AI integration.
