Mention that the Amazon Product graph contains over 100B nodes
but because products are modeled carefully, the site can
recommend products that gain Amazon billions of dollars
of extra revenue every years.  World-class modeling of products and product
reviews by customers can be a HUGE strategic advantage to boost
sales by having precise recommendations.
Note: 35% of Amazon’s sales coming through or being driven by the recommendation engine
According to public financial data, in 2021 Amazon had an annual revenue of roughly US $469.8 billion
So a rough estimate — using the widely cited 35% and 2021 revenue — suggests that Amazon may derive on the order of $150–170 billion per year in sales that are influenced by or come through its recommendation engine.
