## Category Descriptions

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts
Core graph database concepts that form the basis for all other learning. Includes nodes, edges, properties, paths, dependencies, and quality metrics. These are prerequisites for most other concepts in the course.

### KNOWL - Knowledge Representation
Concepts related to representing knowledge in graphs. Includes knowledge graphs, SKOS standard, taxonomies, ontologies, business glossaries, and semantic structures. Essential for understanding how to model meaning and relationships.

### CUST - Customer Domain
Domain-specific concepts for modeling customers and their relationships. Includes individual and corporate customers, households, family relationships, and licensing models. Common starting point for enterprise graph applications.

### PROD - Product Domain
Product-related modeling concepts. Includes product lists, groupings, taxonomies, similarity measures, embeddings, and metadata. Often paired with customer modeling for recommendation systems.

### SPACE - Spatial Modeling
Geographic and location-based concepts. Includes longitude/latitude, distance calculations, addresses, regions, road networks, and shortest path algorithms. Critical for logistics and location-aware applications.

### TIME - Temporal Modeling
Time-related modeling concepts. Includes datetime structures, time trees, hierarchies, financial time, calendars, and exceptions. Foundation for temporal queries and time-series analysis.

### LANG - Language and NLP
Natural language processing and document modeling concepts. Includes word modeling, NLP basics, entity extraction, document pipelines, synonyms, and WordNet. Essential for text-based knowledge extraction.

### HEALTH - Healthcare Domain
Healthcare-specific modeling concepts. Includes patient modeling, clinical data, claims, providers, FHIR standards, care paths, and clinical decision support. Specialized domain with regulatory requirements.

### SECUR - Security and Rules
Security modeling and business rules concepts. Includes threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, RBAC, rule engines, validation rules, and decision trees. Critical for enterprise governance.

### PROC - Process and Events
Business process and event modeling concepts. Includes event modeling, event mining, workflows, event logs, and dashboards. Important for operational analytics and process optimization.

### ADV - Advanced Analytics
Advanced graph analytics concepts. Includes entity resolution, digital twins, scene graphs, causality, lineage, metadata governance, and supply chain modeling. Builds on foundational concepts.

### AIML - Future and AI
AI integration and future directions. Includes brain architecture, 1000 Brains Theory, reference frames, world models, and AI-graph integration. Cutting-edge topics for forward-looking applications.
