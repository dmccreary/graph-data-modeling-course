## Description

This interactive Learning Graph visualizes the 150 core concepts covered in the Graph Data Modeling course and their prerequisite dependencies. The visualization uses a force-directed layout to show how foundational concepts (shown on the left) connect through intermediate topics to advanced goal concepts (shown on the right).

Key features:

- **Interactive exploration**: Click and drag nodes to explore concept relationships
- **Color-coded categories**: Concepts are grouped by topic area (see legend sidebar)
- **Dependency arrows**: Directed edges show prerequisite relationships between concepts
- **Collapsible legend**: Toggle the sidebar to maximize the graph viewing area

### How to Use

1. **Pan and zoom**: Use mouse scroll to zoom in/out, click and drag on the background to pan
2. **Explore nodes**: Click on any concept node to highlight its connections
3. **Toggle legend**: Click the hamburger menu (☰) to show/hide the category legend
4. **Follow dependencies**: Arrows point from prerequisite concepts to dependent concepts

### Concept Categories

| Color | Category |
|-------|----------|
| Red | Foundational Concepts |
| Orange | Structures |
| Yellow | Data Management and Evolution |
| Green | Temporal and Spatial Models |
| Blue | Semantic and Knowledge Graphs |
| Indigo | NLP Models |
| Violet | Customers and Fraud |
| Brown | Products and Supply Chain |
| Gray | Healthcare and Security |
| Black | Miscellaneous |

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify the core concepts required for graph data modeling
- Trace prerequisite dependencies between graph modeling topics
- Recognize concept categories and their relationships
- Plan a learning path through the course material

### Target Audience

- Undergraduate students in computer science or data science programs
- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of databases and data structures

### Activities

1. **Exploration Activity**: Navigate the learning graph to find your current knowledge level. Identify concepts you already understand and those that are new.

2. **Guided Investigation**: Starting from a foundational concept (red nodes on left), trace a path through the graph to an advanced goal concept (gold stars on right). Document the prerequisite chain.

3. **Extension Activity**: Select a goal concept relevant to your interests. Create a personalized learning plan by listing all prerequisite concepts in order.

### Assessment

- What are the foundational concepts that all other graph modeling topics depend upon?
- Choose one advanced topic and explain its prerequisite dependency chain
- How does the learning graph help you understand the structure of the course?
