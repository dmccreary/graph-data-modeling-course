Learning relational databases creates the impressions that all databases have a limited ability to model the real world.  They teach that modeling relationships is complex and relationships are not first class citizens with their own properties.</p> <p>These misconceptions cause students to be overly cautious about modeling the real-world with precision.  Teaching graph data modeling first can help them learn that precise models of the world can give any organization a competitive advantage over their relational-focused competition.</p> <p>This book attempts to teach graph data as THE single most important modeling framework any database students has.</p>"},{"location":"about/#book-structure","title":"Book Structure","text":"<p>This book begins by introducing the foundational concepts we use in modeling the world with graphs.  This includes precise definitions of concepts such as nodes, edges, properties and paths.</p> <p>After we introduce the foundational concepts we enumerate some of the different types of graphs including describing graph structures that don't have the flexibility that we need to build production systems.</p> <p>Next, we introduce the labeled-property graph (LPG) data model and give some concrete examples of how it is used to model the world.</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>Please contact me on LinkedIn</p> <p>Thanks! - Dan</p>"},{"location":"glossary/","title":"Glossary of Terms","text":""},{"location":"glossary/#iso-definition","title":"ISO Definition","text":"<p>A term definition is considered to be consistent with ISO metadata registry guideline 11179 if it meets the following criteria:</p> <ol> <li>Precise</li> <li>Concise</li> <li>Distinct</li> <li>Non-circular</li> <li>Unencumbered with business rules</li> </ol>"},{"location":"glossary/#term","title":"Term","text":"<p>This is the definition of the term.</p>"},{"location":"how-we-built-this-site/","title":"How We Built This Site","text":"<p>This page describes how we built this website and some of  the rationale behind why we made various design choices.</p>"},{"location":"how-we-built-this-site/#python","title":"Python","text":"<p>MicroSims are about how we use generative AI to create animations and simulations.
